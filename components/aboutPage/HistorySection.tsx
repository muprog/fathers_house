            The Vision of The Father&apos;s House started in the place of prayer
            at a time in January 2003. Apostle Richard Udoh had just resigned
            from an executive position in one of the leading new generation
            banks in Nigeria with the sole intention to run a full time
            ministerial assignment with The Foursquare Gospel Church, Saabo,
            Lagos.

          <p className='leading-relaxed'>
            From January 1st 2003, he began to seek the face of the Lord for
            direction in full time ministry. As he prayed, a word came clearly
            from the Lord that he should start an independent ministry. This was
            quite unexpected and incredible to him because he went to pray with
            the mindset of a ministry in The Foursquare Gospel Church in Nigeria
            but God began to point him in another direction entirely.

            He promptly shared this with his wife, who at that time felt he
            should focus on the work at hand without plunging into something
            new. He kept praying and also requested that God should convince
            her. Then came August 2003, after a series of prayers, she became
            convinced and moves were made for proper and procedural exiting of
            the organization he was serving in at that time.

            Having received the full permission of the then General Overseer of
            The Foursquare Gospel Church to leave, he handed over the Pastorate
            of Saabo Foursquare Gospel Church to a new Pastor on December 28th
            2003 and began preparations for the commencement of the new
            ministry, The Manifest Ministry. December 2003 marked a turning
            point in his ministry and life. First, it marked the end of his
            service in the Foursquare movement and secondly, the beginning of an
            independent ministry, The Manifest Ministry ordained by God, of
            which church&apos;s arm is The Father&apos;s House.

            The maiden service of The Father&apos;s House was a crossover
            service on December 31st, 2003 held at 28, Bola Oshikoya Street,
            Alagbole. The service attracted all those who had heard about the
            new spiritual initiative and made enquiries to know its location. A
            total of 58 worshippers (adult and children) attended the inaugural
            service.

            After the maiden edition, subsequent services in January were held
            at the same venue until God provided a landed property at 90,
            Ojodu-Akute Road. The church moved there in February 2004 and ever
            since the Lord has built for Himself a befitting worship sanctuary
            with a modern office complex. God has been so faithful.

            As at July 2011, The Father&apos;s House had planted seven other
            branches around the nation and is planning to do more by the grace
            of God. To God be the glory, great things He has done for us.

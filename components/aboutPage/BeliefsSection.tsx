              <li>
                We believe in God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, that
                is one God.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe on the Bible, which contains the sixty-six books of
                the Old Testament and the New Testament, is the inspired voice
                of God, infallible and living and still has the ultimate
                authority over faith and works.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe Our Lord Jesus Christ was sent by the Father,
                conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, became a
                perfect man and divine, died on the cross as the redemption of
                mankind, and was buried on the third day that he rose bodily
                from the dead, ascended to the Father and again sits at the
                right hand of God the Father to intercede for us, and that he
                will come again in glory and majesty to judge the living and the
                dead.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that the Holy Spirit works in the life of the sinner
                to repents from sins, believes in Jesus Christ and is born again
                to become a new creation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that the Holy Spirit is a perfect deity with all the
                attributes of the divine and that He is worthy of worship and
                adoration.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that man was created in the image of God, fell into
                sin, and is guilty of God's wrath and punishment for this.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the one holy Christian Church, the body of Christ,
                in which the Spirit of God dwells in all who are born again.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in God's absolute authority and sovereignty through
                creation, preservation, revelation, redemption, and ultimate
                punishment.
              </li>
              <li>
                As our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ commanded, We believe that,
                the believers who born again be immersed in water and baptized
                to agree with the resurrection of Christ to show that he died to
                sin and rose to grace in the name of the Father, the Son and the
                Holy Spirit, and the believer will partake of the Lord's Supper
                to proclaim his death until the Lord returns, to show having
                union with the Lord and the believers.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe that the Holy Spirit dwells in the lives of believers
                as in the previous Pentecostal practices that the believer
                receives power when baptized in the Holy Spirit and speaks in
                new tongues, is always filled with the Holy Spirit and works the
                gifts of grace today.
              </li>
              <li>
                We believe in the resurrection, the eternal punishment of
                sinners, and the eternal life of believers.
